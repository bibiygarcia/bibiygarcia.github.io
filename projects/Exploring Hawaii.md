summary: "Hawaii is a wellspring of natural beauty. It is a place rich in culture. Hawaii's landscapes inspire with it's mix of vibrant natural foliage and its ecletic urban scene. During my stay here, I hope to learn more and grow to further appreciate Hawaii in all it's nuances and traditions through the art of photography. "
