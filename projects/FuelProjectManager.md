## Statement

The Fuel Project Manager is a macro-enabled excel spreadsheet that is programmed to assist in calculating and estimating fuel consumption and cost for a given mission. It's primary function is to be used as historical data for mission planning, as well as to be used to calculate fuel usage. I completed this project and presented it to the 552nd Wing Commander in December, 2019. During the creation and post completion of this project I received multiple awards for my efforts including: 
- 729th Air Control Squadron Mission Support Award Tech of the Month (July 2019)
- 729th Air Control Squadron Airman of the 3rd Quarter (1 Jul 2019 - 30 Sep 2019)
- 552nd Air Control Group Airman of the 3rd Quarter (1 Jul 2019 - 30 Sep 2019)
- 552nd Air Control Wing Airman of the 3rd Quarter (1 Jul 2019 - 30 Sep 2019)

The following information is a written summary of the presentation I organized for the Wing Commander.


# Fuel Project Manager
The Fuel Project Manager was created to increase the **efficiency** and **accuracy** of planning, budgeting and scheduling fuel operations for exercises and missions.

## Intro
I started this program to help my supervisor calculate fuel numbers more efficiently. This task effected both of us, considering we managed the Fuel Program for our squadron, and had to order fuel for each exercise. When my leadership told me that this program would be shared with other squadrons I decided to increase it's user friendliness by fully automating the calculations and coding the Excel Workbook, so that any squadron could hand-tailor it to their particular needs.

## Presentation Overview
To begin, I will first cover the basic features and functions of the program, and I'll show you a preview of what the actual program looks like. Following the preview, I'll summaraize what a year's difference would look like, after using the program. I'll also run through the data we collected to make those summary estimations. And lastly, we'll cover how the program effects mission planning and scheduling in area's like, fuel storage capacity and fuel delivery.

## Features and Functionality
First and foremost, the Fuel Project Manager is an Excel Document, meaning that anyone who utilizes Microsoft Excel 2016+ can access all the functions of the program. The only catch being, that it must be saved as a Macro-Enabled Worksheet. The program has an inital size of 650 kb and is small enough to be sent through the government's Outlook application, making it easy to share and highly accessible. 

## Program Preview

#### Fuel Projects Home Page
When first opening the Fuel Project Manager, you will always be taken to the Fuel Projects home page. On the Home Page you'll be able to add and edit projects, set budget and fuel goals, and access the input and output sheets of each project.

#### Equipment Types
Moving on to the Equipment Types page, you'll be able to add various equipment to your program. Once all of your respective exercise or squadron equipment types are loaded, you will be able to access them for any of your projects. 

#### Project Input
On the project input page--which can be accessed via the "Navigate Workbook Button", or it's respective "View Input" icon on the Fuel Project home page--you can choose one of your previously loaded equipment types and enter the desired number of units, mission total hours or distance, the average load, and the number of days of expected usage. 

#### Project Output
From the input page, you can open the project output. In the project output, you can view the total cost, total fuel, and the various individual fuel consumption totals of all the equipment items you previously inputted.

These four pages make up the Fuel Project Manager and concludes our program preview.

## Summary
Now we'll summarize what a year's difference would have looked like, when using the Fuel Program Manager. In 2019, the 729 ACS (Air Control Squadron) participated in 6 exercises. If each exercise, had been comparatively the same as the "Raging Bull Exercise", the 729 would have been able to save:

#### PER EXERCISE SAVINGS:
- 4 to 5 man hours per exercise in calculating and research
- nearly $33,000 per exercise in fuel budget
- 9 P.O.L deliveries (fuel deliveries scheduled) per exercise

#### ANNUAL SAVINGS:
- 24 to 30 man hours per year
- nearly $198,000 per year
- 54 P.O.L deliveries (fuel deliveries scheduled) per year
