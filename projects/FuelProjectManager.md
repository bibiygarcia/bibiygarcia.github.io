## Statement

The Fuel Project Manager is a macro-enabled excel spreadsheet that is programmed to assist in calculating and estimating fuel consumption and cost for a given mission. It's primary function is to be used as historical data for mission planning, as well as to be used to calculate the estimated amount of fuel that will be required for a mission. I completed this project and presented it to the 552nd Wing Commander in December, 2019. During the creation of and post completion of this project I received multiple awards for my efforts including: 

729th Air Control Squadron Mission Support Award Tech of the Mnnth (July 2019)
