As a self-taught artist, I am working toward gaining experience in Adobe Creative Cloud's applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premier. My passion lies in experimenting with various art mediums, which include but are not limited to: photography, videography, and digital art. My goal is to expand my knowledge and skills as an artist.

Through my artistic pursuits, I've discovered that art is not confined to a canvas or screen; it touches every facet of life. From designing a simple door knob to baking a cake, art plays a role in shaping our world. I aim to use my experiences and creativity to enhance my work and cultivate a brighter future.
