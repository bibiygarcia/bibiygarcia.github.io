Let's explore the significance of coding standards, emphasizing their role in improving software quality and aiding in the mastery of a programming language. Coding standards, when implemented effectively, serve as the foundation for maintaining code quality and consistency. Here are some compelling reasons why coding standards matter:

1. **Improved Code Readability:** Consistent formatting and naming conventions make code more readable and understandable. This aids not only the original developer but also anyone who might work on or review the code in the future. Readable code is easier to debug, maintain, and extend.

2. **Enhanced Collaboration:** In a team environment, coding standards are essential for fostering collaboration. When all team members follow the same conventions, it minimizes confusion, reduces code review friction, and ensures that everyone can work on any part of the codebase.

3. **Reduced Error Rates:** Coding standards can help catch potential errors early. For instance, a consistent indentation style can prevent common bugs related to block scope, and naming conventions can make it easier to spot typos or incorrect variable references.

4. **Accelerated Learning:** As mentioned earlier, coding standards can be a powerful tool for learning a programming language. Consistent code patterns and practices provide a structured environment for understanding the language's nuances.

## ESLint with IntelliJ

ESLint, is a popular tool used to enforce coding standards and help identify and fix code issues. IntelliJ, an integrated development environment (IDE), has integrated ESLint into its environment and makes it easy to adhere to coding standards in real-time. Receiving the green checkmark from ESLint has been useful but also vexing. It, ultimately, helps me maintain consistency with my code and allows me to locate issues quickly by detecting and highlighting deviations from coding standards. Due to the strict adherence to standards required to recieve the green checkmark, I have become more proficient in learning Javascript compared to before. The only real annoyances I have with ESLint is the minute deviations in syntax that can really hinder my coding progress. The problem, for me so far, is simply that it differs slightly enough from JSFiddle (the environment I was learning in prior to using ESLint with IntelliJ) that I struggle to identify the source of the problem when I code correctly according to ESLint but incorrectly enough that it does not trigger an error but also does not provide me with the information I am trying to pull. The code will be correct if used in JSFiddle but incorrect if used with ESLint. Fortunately and unfortunately ESLint is has strict coding standards so I'm quickly becoming familiar with the new, slightly different syntax.
